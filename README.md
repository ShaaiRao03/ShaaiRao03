# Hey, I'm Shaai Rao! ðŸ˜Š

## ðŸ”… Introduction

My name is Shaai Rao and I'm a Year 2 Computer Science Student at University of Southampton (Malaysia campus). It is my aspiration to establish myself as a Software Engineer specializing in Machine Learning, an area in which I am currently dedicating my efforts and expertise. With hands-on experience in building applications using languages like Python, Java and Haskell, along with a solid grasp of software design, interaction design, database management, and object-oriented programming, I've established a strong foundation in implementing best practices for developing robust and efficient systems. As someone deeply enthusiastic about learning and eager to take on new challenges, I am keen to engage in project collaborations or seize internship opportunities where I can contribute and further hone my skills.
